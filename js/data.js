INFORMATION ABOUT INCONSISTENT KEYS THAT CAN BE DELETED LATER AFTER I DELVE MORE INTO THIS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND IT:
Why Consistent Keys (e.g., text) Are Recommended

You’re correct that iterating by index lets you access each object (e.g., carComments[0], carComments[1]), but the issue is accessing the comment text inside each object due to inconsistent keys (comment1, comment2, etc.). Here’s why this causes problems and why consistent keys help:
Problem with Inconsistent Keys:
Each object has a different key (comment1, comment2, comment3, etc.), so to get the comment text, you need to know which key to use for each index:
carComments[0].comment1 gets “Oh noooo! I was driving to slow!”

carComments[1].comment2 gets “”, etc.

When iterating, you can’t use a single key to access the text. You’d need logic to match the index to the correct key (e.g., if index === 0, use comment1; if index === 1, use comment2), which is complex and error-prone.

For specific comment selection (e.g., picking “Oh noooo!” for a slow-driving scenario), you must hardcode the key (comment1) and index (0), making your function less flexible.

Why Consistent Keys Help:
Using the same key (e.g., text) for all objects means you can access the comment text with one key, regardless of index:
carComments[0].text, carComments[1].text, etc.

Iteration: In a loop (e.g., index++), you can always use carComments[index].text to get the comment, no extra logic needed.

Specific Selection: To pick a comment (e.g., “Oh noooo!”), use the index (carComments[0].text) or add an id/type property (e.g., { text: "Oh noooo!", type: "slow" }) for clarity, without needing unique keys.

Simpler Functions: A function to display or select comments can assume text as the key, making your code reusable and easier to maintain (user story #24).

Your Concern (No Confusion with Different Keys):
You think different keys (comment1, comment2) help identify comments to avoid confusion, especially for specific functions. However:
Indices Are Enough: The array’s index (0, 1, 2, ...) already identifies each comment uniquely. You can iterate with index++ and select by index (e.g., carComments[0] for “Oh noooo!”).

Unique Keys Add Complexity: Needing to know comment1 vs. comment2 in your function logic is harder than using text and relying on indices or an id property.

Example (no code): If you want “Oh noooo!” for a slow-driving function, check carComments[0].text or add { text: "Oh noooo!", id: "slow" } and filter by id, not comment1.
